# Free and Low-Cost IT Tutorials

Hello!

I'm an information hoarder that finally decided to get all of my bookmarks in order so that they would actually be useful to me as well as others. Feel free to let me know if you have any suggestions on ways to improve this document. These are about topics that are pertinent to me, so this is not comprehensive in any way, but if you have good resources to add, tell me and I will add them :)

## Coding

### General

* [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

    It is what the title says - a free bootcamp to learn how to code. They offer the following certifications, as well as coding interview prep, daily challenges, and professional languages courses (English, Spanish, and Chinese):
	* Responsive Web Design
	* JavaScript
	* Front End Development Libraries
	* Python
	* Relational Databases
	* Back End Development and APIs
	* Full Stack Developer
	* Foundational C# with Microsoft

    I completed an older version of the front end certification and a bit of the old Javascript course several years ago (2017-2020, I picked it up and put it down several times). The HTML was review for me and the CSS and Javascript was more or less new. I remember it had some good practice exercises, including some CSS ones that I had difficulty with. I remember nothing five years later though as I never had to do any real coding and stopped practicing 😅 I do find that I can understand Javascript better than before, even if I can't write it myself.

### Python
* [Future Coder](https://futurecoder.io/)
    Future Coder is an interactive beginner Python tutorial. It covers strings, variables, loops, if statements, lists, functions, boolean operators, and dictionaries. 

    I completed the entire tutorial in a few weeks and found it helpful because it actually forces you to write your own code. You can get hints or the solution, if you get really stuck, but it has several tools to help you debug your code on your own. One thing I enjoyed was the Tic Tac Toe project; it helps you build up the functions as you go and ultimately you write a complete game program.

* [Genepy](https://genepy.org/)

    Genepy is an interactive site with Python exercises from easy to very hard difficulty. As of writing this, there are 85 exercises total covering a range of topics, including a few numpy and command line exercises.

    I've completed all 21 easy exercises and 3 of the medium ones. I find these types of interactive websites **extremely** helpful because it gets me writing code and thinking about the best ways to attack coding problems, but in a supported way.

* [CheckiO](https://py.checkio.org/)

    CheckiO is another interactive website full of Python exercises. They also have a TypeScript section, but I've not used it, so I'm just going to talk about the Python side. I'm not sure how many exercises it has in total, but I've completed 30 of the Strings and Integers ones out of about 60. There are several other categories, including lists, dictionaries, and others. Some of them have vague names like "Rock," and I haven't unlocked many yet, so I'm not sure what they cover.

    I love this site! The exercises stretch my Python knowledge and I often have to look up how to do things, which gets me learning new methods. This page doesn't offer quite as much assistance as some other sites do, but there are hints available if you need them. 

    There is a paid option for this site which removes ads and has more content. I haven't hit any walls yet where I feel I need to pay for it, but I would consider it in the future if I felt limited or if I just wanted to show financial support for the website.

## IT

### General


### Security

* [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/)
    This is my **favorite** site for learning cybersecurity!! It has a lot of free content, but it's not all free. However, I personally find it worth the money to purchase an annual membership. You can often get a discount around November/December when they do their annual Advent of Cyber (AoC) event - 24 days of hacking challenges for all ability levels! AoC is actually what first drew me to the website, I took the deal, and I haven't looked back.

    THM releases new content weekly and is always striving to outdo itself. They recently launched a couple of paid certifications to compete with other security certifications. I can say that their content is much more in-depth than others I've done. I have completed the Google Cybersecurity Certification on Coursera and the Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) certification from ISC(2) and THM is on a whole other level in terms of beginner content. I have completed the Pre Security path and am ~40% of the way through the Cyber Security 101 path, which theoretically should prepare me to take SEC1, their beginner certification. I'm learning **so much** through this content!! THM has very simple, well-written explanations for what they teach and the site is interactive so you actually get to practice what you're learning. They have virtual desktops (Linux, aside from the Windows topics which use Windows) you access through the website that you can safely hack on. It's very cool and very fun!

    They have red, blue, and purple team paths, as well as red and blue team certifications, once you get through the 101 path. Additionally, there are hundreds (thousands?) of THM and user-created rooms you can do to learn other skills or practice ones you've already learned. They go from absolute beginner to extremely advanced difficulty, so there is something for everyone. I know I'm going on about this site, but it is literally one of my favorite websites on the entire internet, no joke. I love THM!

* [Roppers Academy](https://www.roppers.org/)

    Roppers Academy offers several completely free courses for learning various IT skills:

	* Computing Fundamentals (mostly focuses on Linux)
	* Capture the Flag Bootcamp
	* Security Fundamentals
	* Technical Security Fundamentals
	* Practical Networking

    This site is very cybersecurity-focused, but the content goes beyond security. The person who started the site is a former training officer for the US Naval Academy's CTF team and he started the site to help people learn security and train for CTFs. They have CTF team Discord you can join if you want to participate in CTFs with them. 

    I made it about 50% of the way through the computing fundamentals several years ago. From what I recall, the course was video-based, then each section had homework you completed and turned in for approval. The personality of the author is pretty heavy throughout the course, including having readings about mindset and that kind of thing, but overall I was learning quite a bit in here and I really liked the personal element of having an actual human check over my assignments.

* [Over the Wire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/)

    Over the Wire has several different hacking games to practice different aspects of security, including:

	* Unix/Linux basics
	* Web security
	* Cryptography
	* Reverse engineering
	* Binary exploitation

    I've only done the first handful of levels in Bandit, the beginner Unix/Linux basics game, so I can't really say a lot about the more difficult ones. However, even this game is challenging. [Roppers Academy](https://www.roppers.org/) uses Bandit in its Computing Fundamentals course to help people learn Linux commands. The way the game works is you SSH into a server and try to figure out the password to get to the next level. It's pretty fun and I hope to complete it one of these days...
